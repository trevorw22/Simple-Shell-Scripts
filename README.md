# Simple-Shell-Scripts

This is a collection of shell scripts I created that I use regularly to speed up my workflow, automate boring things, and keep organized.  

# speedlog.sh
SpeedLog is a shell script which performs and logs speed tests in the background automatically.  
It is especially handy when used it with a cronjob to get a report of my internet speed fluxuations every few minutes.  

# youtube.sh  
This shell script downloads YouTube videos into an organized, single folder instead of scattered in different places.  
It requires youtube-dl to function.
