# Simple-Shell-Scripts

This is a collection of shell scripts I created that I use regularly to speed up my workflow, automate boring things, and keep organized.  
# youtube.sh  
youtube.sh is a little script that keeps my downloaded YouTube videos organized in a single folder instead of scattered all over my harddrive.
