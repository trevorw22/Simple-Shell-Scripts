# Simple-Shell-Scripts

This is a collection of shell scripts I created that I use regularly to speed up my workflow, automate boring things, and keep organized.  

# youtube.sh  
youtube.sh is a little script that downloads YouTube videos into an organized, single folder instead of scattered in different places.  
It requires youtube-dl to function.
